**Title**

AI-Powered Behavioral Analysis for Suicide Prevention,
Substance Use, and Mental Health Crisis Detection with Longitudinal Geospatial
Crisis Trend Analysis

---

**Synopsis**

Public health agencies often face challenges in detecting
and responding to mental health, suicide, and substance use crises in real time
due to delays in traditional reporting systems. In todayâ€™s digital age, these
crises are increasingly expressed through social media and online communication
platforms, which have become central to human interaction.

This project proposes an AI-powered early warning system
that uses Natural Language Processing (NLP), behavioral analysis, and
geospatial mapping to monitor these platforms for signs of emotional distress
and crisis escalation. It aims to provide a robust framework for governments,
public health agencies, private organizations, and other stakeholders to
identify, track, and mitigate emerging mental health crises.

Key features include a crisis detection system that analyzes
engagement behaviors over time, an early-warning mechanism to enable preemptive
resource deployment, and a real-time monitoring module that informs long-term
intervention strategies. To ensure accessibility and usability, the system will
be accompanied by an interactive dashboard that visualizes trends and insights
for decision-makers.

**Approach:**

**Phase 1: Research & Requirements Gathering**

* Conduct
  a literature review on mental health indicators, language cues, and
  behavioral patterns associated with distress.
* Study
  government and public health data reporting standards.
* Analyze
  requirements of potential stakeholders (e.g., government health
  departments, NGOs, crisis lines).
* Finalize
  ethical and privacy guidelines for handling public data.

---

**Phase 2: Crisis Lexicon & Data Pipeline Development**

* **Build a multi-layered lexicon** of explicit
  and coded crisis-related terms (suicidality, substance use, etc.), slang,
  emojis, and metaphors.
* Implement **NLP pipelines** to:
  * Detect distress-related language.
  * Perform sentiment and emotion analysis.
  * Classify topic relevance using LDA or BERT-based
    topic models.
  * Incorporate multilingual support if feasible.
* Incorporate **image analysis** to:
  * Detect visual indicators of self-harm, drug use, or
    emotional distress in posted images.
  * Classify meme-based or coded visual content tied to
    mental health topics.
  * Apply OCR (Optical Character
    Recognition) to extract text from images (e.g., screenshots of chats or
    handwritten notes).
* Incorporate  **voice analysis** :
  * Use speech-to-text models to transcribe
    voice messages or videos.
  * Apply emotion recognition using
    acoustic features with deep learning models.
  * Detect specific keywords or
    sentiment shifts in spoken content, similar to the NLP pipeline.

---

**Phase 3: Behavioral & Engagement Analysis**

* Track
  how users interact with crisis-related content (likes, shares, replies,
  frequency of posting).
* Build
  models to detect **distress escalation patterns** over time.
* Tailor
  models to fit industry-specific calls distress patterns.
* Evaluate
  outreach effectiveness by correlating engagement patterns with known
  interventions.

---

**Phase 4: Geospatial &
Temporal Trend Mapping**

Use metadata or NLP-based
location extraction to geotag discussions.

* Integrate
  **GeoPandas** ,  **Folium** , or **Leaflet.js** for mapping spatial
  patterns.
* Analyze
  and visualize **longitudinal trends** to identify growing regional
  crises.
* Generate
  **heatmaps and time-series charts** to track changes.

---

**Phase 5: Framework Architecture & Customization APIs**

* Modularize
  all components (lexicon, NLP pipeline, trend detection, visualizer).
* Develop
  **APIs or configuration modules** for:
  * Adding
    custom keywords or crisis definitions.
  * Setting
    geospatial boundaries.
  * Connecting
    to internal data systems
* Provide
  integration guides for health departments and NGOs.

---

**Phase 6: Interactive Dashboard & Visualization Layer**

* Build
  a front-end dashboard using **ReactJS **and **JavaScript viz
  libraries.**
* Display:
  * Real-time
    crisis alerts.
  * Longitudinal
    and geospatial trends.
  * Engagement
    metrics and behavioral patterns.
* Allow
  users to filter by location, time, language, and crisis type.

---

**Phase 7: Testing, Documentation, and Final Packaging**

* Conduct
  testing on sample datasets (e.g., Reddit, X, forums).
* Collaborate
  with private and public agencies towards deploying the solution onto their
  systems.
* Write
  detailed documentation covering:
  * Setup
    and deployment.
  * Ethics
    and data usage policies.
  * Extension
    and customization examples.
* Open-source
  the project under an appropriate license.
